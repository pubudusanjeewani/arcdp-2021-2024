## Abstract

In deep learning, the opaqueness of complex models poses significant challenges
to their broader acceptance and trustworthiness. Existing explainability methods
typically focus either on local or global model insights, failing to integrate these
perspectives into a cohesive understanding. This work introduces a novel frame-
work that leverages GradCAM++ and Integrated Gradients with graph-based
techniques to provide a comprehensive, multi-perspective explanation of deep
learning models. The proposed method identifies critical input regions, enhanc-
ing understanding of model behavior through intuitive visual heatmaps and
graph-based representations. In the proposed technique, nodes depict clusters of
significant features, while edges quantify the intensity of their interactions, offer-
ing insights into both localized and systemic feature relationships. We validate
our framework on standard image classification and segmentation datasets using
pre-trained networks, demonstrating enhanced model interpretability through
detailed feature interaction analysis. Furthermore, we present comprehensive
evaluation based on faithfulness, robustness, and computational efficiency met-
rics, ensuring the framework’s reliability and practical applicability. The extended
evaluation provides the utility of proposed approach to provide transparent and
robust model explanations, contributing significantly to the field’s pursuit of
explainable AI.
