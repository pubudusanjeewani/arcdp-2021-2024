## Abstract

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in computer vision tasks. However, traditional CNNs rely on iterative backpropagation for training, which suffers from issues like slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this paper, we introduce a **non-iterative method** that leverages the **Gram-Schmidt process** to directly compute the CNN classifier's weights. This method eliminates the need for iterative training and improves the model's predictive accuracy.

We validated the proposed method on two benchmark datasets: **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10**, and demonstrated that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
